      <p>Overwatch is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment.
        Described as a "hero shooter," Overwatch assigns players into two teams of six, with each player selecting from
        a roster of over 30 characters, known as "heroes," each with a unique style of play that is divided into three
        general roles that fit their purpose. Players on a team work together to secure and defend control points on a
        map or escort a payload across the map in a limited amount of time. Players gain cosmetic rewards that do not
        affect gameplay, such as character skins and victory poses, as they play the game.</p>
